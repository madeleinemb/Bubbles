                            law profession. Our research - interviews and surveys - showed that users were less technologically intuitive than many apps in the space were assuming,
                            so I didn’t want to get rid of the helpful, value-adding option menu that had <strong>clear icons and names</strong> (i.e. descriptions) for each action.<br><br>

                            I and the lead designer were ultimately overruled after voicing the concern, but of course we did not take it per++sonally because it’s part of the natural
                            give-and-take of working in a team and in product development where interpretation is everything.

                    <em>Taking into account all possible user needs...</em>
                    In the seemingly rare ‘edge case,’ where a lawyer or law professional is 1) already a user within the Lupl system but 2) uses a different email address to sign into Teams and 3) is added to a matter
                    via Teams and 4) enters their original Lupl credentials when signing into access the Lupl tab on Teams, what should happen?
                    <br><br>
                    As you can see on the screen <strong>we solved this issue by prioritizing confidentiality and security based on our user story prioritizations.</strong> We inform the user that the email addresses they were using
                    didn’t match and how to fix it as opposed to auto-adding their Lupl creds to the matter, and still not forcing them to exit Teams, a real hassle according to user interviews.
